# Sample AI assistant

You need an `OPENAI_API_KEY` and a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to run this code. Store them in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project, or set them as environment variables. I've added and edited alot from Santiago's original code,so got his git for tne original code.

If you are running the code on Apple Silicon, run the following command:

```
$ brew install portaudio
```

Create a virtual environment, update pip, and install the required packages:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -U pip
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the assistant:

```
$ python3 assistant.py
```
